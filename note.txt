OAuth 2.0 Simplified by Aaron Parecki is a nice reference 

 Problem It Solves:
Let users give apps access to some of their data without giving them their password.

Example: Let a to-do list app write events to your Google Calendar.

🔐 Key Concept:
Apps get access tokens, not passwords.

These tokens represent permissions (called scopes) and are short-lived.

🎭 Actors:
Resource Owner: You (the user)

Client: App that wants access (e.g., To-Do App)

Authorization Server: Handles login + issues tokens (e.g., Google)

Resource Server: Hosts the API (e.g., Google Calendar API)

resource and Authorization: none of the two are actually the app's 


❓Why can't you send the token request body as JSON?
Because OAuth 2.0 spec mandates that the token request be sent with:

bash
Copy
Edit
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Not JSON (application/json).

🔐 OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint Specification
Per the RFC 6749 § 4.1.3 (Authorization Code Grant), the client must send:

makefile
Copy
Edit
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=...&redirect_uri=...&client_id=...
